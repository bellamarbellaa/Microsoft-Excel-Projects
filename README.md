# Microsoft-Excel-Projects
This repository contains the projects I did on Microsoft Excel, exploring the concepts of data cleaning, formatting, organizing, analysis and visualizations. All of these projects are executed as part of my work during certifications from Google, Udemy, and Coding Studio. 

Here are the highlights of concepts I learned during the making of these projects:
IF() and IFS() conditionals with nested logic
Aggregate formulas (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN) with conditionals
VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and INDEX MATCH
Financial formulas like PMT and NPER
Formula tracing, error checking, and Watch Window
Sorting and Filtering Data in A Table
Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and how to choose the right data grouping
Calculated fields and grouping in Pivot Tables
Macros enablement & macro security
Subtotal calculation and use case in a table
Conditional formatting & data validation
Advanced filtering, sorting, and number formatting
Advanced charts (combo, funnel, box & whisker, waterfall, map) and how to draw insights from them
Workbook & worksheet protection
Linking across sheets and files
