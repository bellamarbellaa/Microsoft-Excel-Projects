# Microsoft-Excel-Projects
This repository contains the projects I did on Microsoft Excel, exploring the concepts of data cleaning, formatting, organizing, analysis and visualizations. All of these projects are executed as part of my work during certifications from Google, Udemy, and Coding Studio. 

Here are the highlights of concepts I learned during the making of these projects:
1) IF() and IFS() conditionals with nested logic
2) Aggregate formulas (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN) with conditionals
3) VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and INDEX MATCH
4) Financial formulas like PMT and NPER
5) Formula tracing, error checking, and Watch Window
7) Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and how to choose the right data grouping
8) Calculated fields and grouping in Pivot Tables
9) Macros enablement macro security
10) Copying macro between workbooks
11) Creating form using Macro
12) Subtotal calculation and use case in a table
13) Conditional formatting & data validation
14) Advanced filtering, sorting, and number formatting
15) Advanced charts (combo, funnel, box & whisker, waterfall, map) and how to draw insights from them
16) Workbook & worksheet protection
17) Linking across sheets and files
18) Changing the components of ribbons on Excel as well as language & privacy settings on workbook
